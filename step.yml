  Runs Xcode's `test` action, on an iOS project.

  Write the tests and run them on every build just to make sure those tiny
  code goblins didn't put something in the code that shouldn't be there while
  you were at the daily Scrum meeting.

        Options added to the end of the `xcodebuild build test` call.

        If you leave empty this input, xcodebuild will be called as:

        `xcodebuild
          -project\-workspace PROJECT.xcodeproj\WORKSPACE.xcworkspace

          build test

        In case of `generate_code_coverage_files: "yes"`
        `xcodebuild` gets two additional flags:

        * GCC_INSTRUMENT_PROGRAM_FLOW_ARCS=YES
        * GCC_GENERATE_TEST_COVERAGE_FILES=YES

        If you want to add more options, list that separated by space character.
        Example: `-xcconfig PATH -verbose`
  - single_build: "true"
    opts:
      title: "Run xcodebuild test only"
      description: |-
        If `single_build: false` step runs `xcodebuild OPTIONS build OPTIONS` before the test,
        to generate the project derived datas. After that comes `xcodebuild OPTIONS build test OPTIONS`,
        which command's log is presented in the setp's log.

        If `single_build: true`, then step calls only `xcodebuild OPTIONS build test OPTIONS`.

  opts:
    title: The full, raw test output file path
    description: |-
      This is the path of the raw test results log file.

      If the compilation fails this log will contain the compilation output,
      if the tests can be started it'll only include the test output.
- BITRISE_XCODE_TEST_ATTACHMENTS_PATH:
  opts:
    title: The full, test attachments zip path
