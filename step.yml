  Runs Xcode's `test` action, on an iOS project.

  Write the tests and run them on every build just to make sure those tiny
  code goblins didn't put something in the code that shouldn't be there while
  you were at the daily Scrum meeting.

        * iPhone 6 Plus
        * iPad
        * iPad Air
        * Apple TV 1080p (don't forget to set the platform to `tvOS Simulator` to use this option!)

        If output_tool is set to xcpretty, the xcodebuild output will be prettified by xcpretty.

      description: |-
        Options added to the end of the `xcodebuild build test` call.

        If you leave empty this input, xcodebuild will be called as:

        `xcodebuild
          -project\-workspace PROJECT.xcodeproj\WORKSPACE.xcworkspace
          -scheme SCHEME
          build test
          -destination platform=PLATFORM Simulator,name=NAME,OS=VERSION`

        In case of `generate_code_coverage_files: "yes"`
        `xcodebuild` gets two additional flags:

        * GCC_INSTRUMENT_PROGRAM_FLOW_ARCS=YES
        * GCC_GENERATE_TEST_COVERAGE_FILES=YES

        If you want to add more options, list that separated by space character.
        Example: `-xcconfig PATH -verbose`
  - single_build: "true"
    opts:
      category: Debug
      title: "Run xcodebuild test only"
      description: |-
        If `single_build: false` step runs `xcodebuild OPTIONS build OPTIONS` before the test,
        to generate the project derived datas. After that comes `xcodebuild OPTIONS build test OPTIONS`,
        which command's log is presented in the setp's log.

        If `single_build: true`, then step calls only `xcodebuild OPTIONS build test OPTIONS`.
      value_options:
      - "true"
      - "false"
  - should_build_before_test: "yes"
    opts:
      category: Debug
      title: "(Experimental) Explicitly perform a build before testing?"
      description: |-
        Previous Xcode versions and configurations may throw the error `iPhoneSimulator: Timed out waiting 120 seconds for simulator to boot, current state is 1.`
        when the compilation before performing the tests takes too long.

        This is fixed by running `xcodebuild OPTIONS build test OPTIONS` instead of `xcodebuild OPTIONS test OPTIONS`.
        Calling an explicit build before the test results in the code being compiled twice, thus creating an overhead.

        Unless you are sure that your configuration is not prone to this error, it is recommended to leave this option turned on.
      value_options:
        - "yes"
        - "no"
      is_required: true
  - should_retry_test_on_fail: "no"
    opts:
      category: Debug
      title: "(Experimental) Rerun test, when it fails?"
      description: |-
        If `should_retry_test_on_fail: yes` step will retry the test if first attempt failed.
      value_options:
        - "yes"
        - "no"
      is_required: true
  - xcpretty_test_options: --color --report html --output "${BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR}/xcode-test-results-${BITRISE_SCHEME}.html"
    opts:
      category: Debug
      title: Additional options for `xcpretty` test call
      description: |-
        Options added to the end of the `xcpretty` test call.

        If you leave empty this input, xcpretty will be called as:

        `set -o pipefail && XCODEBUILD_TEST_COMMAND | xcpretty`

        In case of leaving this input on default value:

        `set -o pipefail && XCODEBUILD_TEST_COMMAND | xcpretty --color --report html --color --report html --output "${BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR}/xcode-test-results-${BITRISE_SCHEME}.html"

        If you want to add more options, list that separated by space character.
  - wait_for_simulator_boot: "yes"
    opts:
      category: Debug
      title: "(Experimental) Wait to simulator boot?"
      description: |-
        Wait to simulator boot or start test immediately?
      value_options:
        - "yes"
        - "no"
outputs:
- BITRISE_XCODE_TEST_RESULT:
  opts:
    title: Result of the tests. 'succeeded' or 'failed'.
    value_options:
    - succeeded

- BITRISE_XCODE_RAW_TEST_RESULT_TEXT_PATH:
  opts:
    title: The full, raw test output file path
    description: |-
      This is the path of the raw test results log file.

      If the compilation fails this log will contain the compilation output,
      if the tests can be started it'll only include the test output.
- BITRISE_XCODE_TEST_ATTACHMENTS_PATH:
  opts:
    title: The full, test attachments zip path
    description: |-
      This is the path of the test attachments zip.
